• Learners struggle to find study partners with matching skills and availability, hindering effective group learning. Developed a 
  smart Study Circle Matching algorithm to connect users for better collaboration. 
• Learners can’t always afford new courses immediately after finishing one, interrupting their progress. Built SkillCircle, a 
  MERN app enabling easy peer-to-peer course exchanges for affordable, continuous learning. 
• Added real-time chat and AI-powered doubt-solving to help students get instant support during study sessions. 
• Developed two-way communication using Socket.io. 
• Ensured robust platform security by implementing JWT-based authentication with role-based access control, encrypted user 
  credentials, and protected API routes.
